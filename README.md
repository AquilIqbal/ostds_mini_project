# ⚽ FIFA World Cup 2022 - Football Match Win Prediction

- This project is a part of the **Open Source Tools for Data Science (OSTDS)** course mini-project. It aims to predict the outcome of football matches from the **FIFA World Cup 2022** using **Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning** techniques implemented in Python.

## This project demonstrated the complete workflow of:

- Data Analytics using Python 🐍
- Analysis and visualization in Jupyter Notebooks 📊
- Applying core Data Science & Machine Learning principles 🤖

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, converting string percentages to numerical format, and engineering target variables.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA): Visualization using seaborn and matplotlib to discover insights and correlations between features.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- 🧪 **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy scores, F1-scores, confusion matrices, and comparison bar plots.
- 🌟 **Feature Importance**: Analyzing which match statistics most influence the match result.
